# COMM4190 Spring 2025 - Research Project


Welcome to my research project for COMM 4190: Talking with AI; Computational and Communication Approaches. This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of parent–teacher conferences, a communicative setting that is often marked by power imbalances, role ambiguity, and lack of preparation. While LLMs are already being used widely by students and teachers for tasks like studying and lesson planning, their application in school–home communication—particularly parent–teacher conferences—remains largely unexplored.

Through a literature review, I identified recurring issues in parent–teacher conferences such as unclear expectations, teacher-dominated conversations, and challenges in equitable participation. I then ran a small experiment using ChatGPT as the "teacher" in a simulated conference to evaluate how well an LLM could help address some of these problems.

This project aims to contribute to the growing conversation around AI’s role in education by considering how LLMs might improve communication, efficiency, and inclusivity in one of the most important school–home interactions. Please explore the links to my final paper, bibliography, and ChatGPT prompts to learn more about my process and findings.
