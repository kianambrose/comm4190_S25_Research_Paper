    "# Bridging the Conversation: How LLMs Can Improve Parent–Teacher Conferences\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "As large language models become more advanced and accessible, students are increasingly using them to help with homework, studying, and note-taking. It is no secret that LLMs save time and effort, especially as their accuracy and consistency improve. In addition to students, teachers are also turning to LLMs for drafting lesson plans, generating quiz questions, and personalizing instruction. Yet communication in parent–teacher conferences remains largely untouched by these tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper explores how LLMs could support and improve the parent–teacher conference process. While students and teachers already use LLMs in everyday academic tasks, there has been little research into their role in school–home communication. Studies on parent–teacher conferences consistently point to inefficiencies, vague role expectations, and a lack of meaningful dialogue. This paper examines those recurring challenges and proposes practical ways in which LLMs might help address them. The paper concludes with a small-scale experiment testing the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, followed by a discussion of the results and their broader implications for educational communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, both teachers and parents have raised concerns that parent–teacher conferences often fall short of their intended purpose. A central reason for this is the lack of clarity around the roles each party is expected to play. As Munthe and Westergård (2016) observe, \"The roles that teachers are expected to fulfill have been described as ‘diffuse and limitless’ for parents and ‘specific and limited’ for teachers\" (p. 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This disconnect is partly due to the limited training teachers receive for scenarios like parent–teacher conferences. According to Walker and Dotger (2012), \"Despite the positive impact of family-school partnerships, most teacher education programs fail to help novice teachers develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions they will need to engage families as an educational resource\" (p. 62).\n",
    "\n",
    "Without consistent guidance or professional development in this area, many teachers rely on personal experience or intuition. This approach can lead to inconsistent or strained interactions. As Munthe and Westergård (2016) put it, \"If teachers are not well-prepared for this crucial aspect of their work, their capacity to establish partnerships will likely depend more on their individual abilities rather than the foundational knowledge of their profession\" (p. 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This gap in preparation highlights a promising opportunity for the use of LLMs. These tools could act as training partners, offering simulated conversations and real-time feedback to help teachers build confidence and skill in family engagement. Beyond preparation, LLMs could also play a direct role in the conferences themselves by helping structure conversations, clarify expectations, or even prompt equitable participation. For example, Ferrara and Ferrara (2005, as cited in Walker & Dotger, 2012) found that many teacher candidates *\"do not know how to make their classrooms parent-friendly... or how to talk with parents without using teacher language\" (p. 77). An LLM could assist by translating educational jargon into more accessible, empathetic phrasing, helping teachers communicate more clearly and inclusively with families.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to role ambiguity, power imbalances between teachers and parents are a recurring issue. Teachers often dominate the discussion, not necessarily out of intent, but because they are the ones guiding the agenda. As Munthe and Westergård (2016) note, \"Time is limited, and teachers control this time. They maintain the pace needed to ‘get through’ all the topics on their agenda\" (p. 5). Without formal training or support, covering everything meaningfully in such a short time can be a challenge. This is where LLMs could help. For instance, an LLM could help structure the conversation ahead of time by identifying key topics, generating summaries, or even prioritizing talking points based on the needs of each student. In some cases, LLMs could even take on part of the teacher’s role, reducing time constraints by offering asynchronous conversations that allow families to ask questions and receive responses tailored to their child. This shift could ease the burden on teachers while giving families more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond time management, LLMs could also help rebalance the interaction. As Lemmer (2012) points out, \"Parent–teacher conferences are characterised by a client orientation to parents, rather than a partnership orientation to home–school relations\" (p. 83). If used thoughtfully, LLMs could encourage more equal communication by prompting questions, offering feedback, or helping parents prepare ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond power dynamics, culture and language add another layer of friction. Cultural and linguistic barriers often contribute to miscommunication and feelings of exclusion during conferences. Research shows that families from minority or immigrant backgrounds often experience these meetings from a disadvantaged position. Lemmer (2012) writes, \"Parents from different language and ethnic minority backgrounds may experience the school from a subordinate position... schools who implement effective home–school relations should critically examine their partnership with the home\" (p. 86). LLMs, though not without their own limitations, could offer multilingual and culturally sensitive support that helps bridge this gap. Whether through real-time translation or guidance on phrasing difficult concerns, LLMs could empower parents who might otherwise feel unsure or unheard. This is especially important in light of Solberg’s (2023) finding that \"immigrant parents have reported a sense of being evaluated\" in these interactions (p. 384). By helping to level the communicative playing field, LLMs could support more equitable participation and reduce the power imbalances that often go unaddressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue that has emerged in the research is the question of privacy. Teachers sometimes ask for personal family information without clearly explaining why it's necessary. As Solberg (2023) notes, \"In neither of the cases examined in this paper did the teachers’ eliciting actions appear to be necessary to take care of the child’s well-being\" (p. 384). This kind of boundary crossing, even if unintentional, can make parents feel uncomfortable or judged. LLMs could help by offering a way to rehearse conversations in advance, allowing parents to decide how much they’re comfortable sharing and helping them prepare polite ways to set limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, privacy is also a concern when it comes to using LLMs themselves. If parents are going to interact with an AI system, it’s essential that those tools are secure and transparent about how data is handled. Without clear privacy protections, parents may be hesitant to engage at all. For LLMs to be effective in this space, trust and confidentiality must be built into their design and clearly communicated from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is limited research on using LLMs specifically for parent–teacher conferences, a few tools already exist to support teachers in preparing for them. One example is **AIForTeachers**, a platform that helps generate personalized preparation guides. It asks for details like the student’s education level, strengths, areas for growth, parent concerns, and conference goals. Based on this information, it produces talking points and a guide for the teacher to use during the meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also growing guides and templates showing teachers how to use ChatGPT to speed up everyday communication tasks, like writing emails and letters to parents. This allows teachers to provide more frequent updates and reach more families than they would have time for otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these tools focus on helping teachers plan ahead or communicate more efficiently outside of live conversations. While that’s valuable, I believe LLMs could go a step further by potentially acting as a stand-in during parts of the conference itself. For instance, if the teacher enters key student data beforehand, the LLM could answer common questions from parents or help guide the conversation. In a hybrid setup, the teacher might “drop in” virtually to support the LLM when needed, allowing for more conferences to take place in less time. At the very least, this kind of system could reduce scheduling stress and increase access, especially in large or under-resourced schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while parent–teacher conferences are meant to foster collaboration, they often fall short due to role ambiguity, time constraints, cultural barriers, and privacy concerns. LLMs could help address many of these issues by offering teachers low-pressure training opportunities, helping parents rehearse conversations or questions, providing real-time translation and simplification, and setting clearer boundaries around sensitive topics. Whether used as planning tools or as active participants in the conference process, LLMs have the potential to make these meetings more inclusive, efficient, and collaborative.\n",

    "## Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "To test how LLMs might support parent–teacher conferences, I designed a small experiment using ChatGPT to simulate the role of a high school math teacher. I provided it with background information about a fictional student named Jack, whose parents would be attending a conference. The goal was to see how effectively the LLM could respond to typical parent questions and concerns, and whether it could help address some of the challenges discussed in the literature review; specifically, role ambiguity, power imbalances, and lack of teacher preparation. While I believe LLMs could also support areas like language accessibility, privacy, and time constraints, this experiment focused only on the first three issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, I found that the LLM performed surprisingly well in addressing several of the core concerns outlined in the literature on parent–teacher conferences. As the parent in the scenario, I never felt uncertain about my role in the conversation, nor did the teacher (the LLM) come across as unsure or unprepared. The exchange felt balanced. The LLM began by clearly summarizing Jack’s academic performance and behavioral tendencies, then invited my thoughts and questions. This structure helped avoid the power imbalance that studies like those by Lemmer and Munthe & Westergård describe, where teachers often dominate the conversation and parents feel more like passive recipients than active participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "What stood out most was the LLM’s ability to make the interaction feel like a dialogue, not a monologue. After each of its responses, it asked for my opinion or whether I had anything to add. This created space for parental voice and aligned with the idea of fostering a partnership rather than maintaining a client–service provider dynamic. The language it used was accessible and friendly—free of jargon—and did not feel like “teacher talk,” addressing a concern highlighted by Ferrara & Ferrara. At no point did I feel talked down to or confused by phrasing, which made the experience feel welcoming and collaborative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM also projected a sense of preparation. Its responses were fluid and timely, which gave the impression that the teacher was well-organized and thoughtful—even though, of course, no real teacher had prepared for the conversation. This seemed to address the teacher preparation gap mentioned by Walker & Dotger. Finally, because the LLM isn’t bound by tight scheduling like a human teacher might be, I never felt rushed. The conversation ended when I was ready, not when a timer ran out. This open-ended structure made the whole process feel more thorough and satisfying.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this small experiment showed that LLMs could play a real role in improving some of the most common problems in parent–teacher conferences, especially around role clarity, teacher preparedness, and conversational balance. While more testing is needed across diverse scenarios, this trial suggests real potential for using LLMs to make parent–teacher interactions more inclusive, fluid, and effective.\n"
